# Predictive-Modeling-for-Treatment-Outcomes-in-Alcohol-and-Nicotine-Use-Disorders

This repository contains a proof-of-concept project aimed at developing a predictive model to forecast patient responses to treatments for Alcohol and Nicotine Use Disorders. The goal is to identify which patients are likely to respond positively to the treatment based on their initial assessments and demographic information.

## Project Overview

### Objective
To build and evaluate a predictive model that can accurately forecast treatment outcomes for patients with substance use disorders, specifically focusing on alcohol and nicotine use.

### Data Sources
- **Datasets**: NIDA Data Share, SAMHSA Data, and ASI Data.

### Key Steps
1. **Data Acquisition**: Loading and preparing data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, normalizing/standardizing features, and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and identifying key features.
4. **Feature Selection**: Using correlation analysis to select relevant features.
5. **Model Development**: Training and evaluating models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest).
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.
7. **Model Interpretation**: Generating confusion matrices to visualize model predictions.
